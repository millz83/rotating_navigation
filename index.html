        <h1>Sinatra aka Huggies</h1>
        <small><strong>2012-2018</strong></small>
        <p>Sinatra was the best dog anyone could ever ask for. He was a gentle giant with a big loving heart. He loved everyone and he really loved kids. He adored my Analyssa, he loved her before she was born.
            His nickname was Huggies because he loved being hugged. He would always bark outdside to be petted. If no one petted him. he would look so sad. However, if he did get some attention, he would walk along, wagging his tail excitely as if his day was made; he accomplished something.
            He was a big goofy, loving dog that loved being treated like a baby.
            He will be forever missed.

        </p>
